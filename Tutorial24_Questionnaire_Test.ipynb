    "Hi and welcome to the Sportlogiq DA Questionnaire! The goal with this questionnaire is to assess your problem solving, hockey knowledge, attention to detail, coding/stats abilities and your (hopeful) fit with some of our day-to-day tasks. If you find yourself stuck or unsure on a question, showing your work and explaining your problem solving/decision making is still highly recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries:\n",
    "- You'll want to import libraries such as numpy, pandas, a plotting library like plotly/matplotlib, and a stats library of your choosing (sklearn for example)\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Info:\n",
    "- There are two data files & a rink template for scatter plots. One data file has a condensed event set from a randomly chosen hockey game and the other contains Expected Goals values (xG) to be merged onto shot attempts for this game. **If an xG value does not correspond to a shot event, it should not be counted**\n",
    "\n",
    "- X and Y Coordinates are in feet and are adjusted such that both teams attack from left (dz) to right (oz)\n",
    "    - X values range from -100 (end boards behind the DZ net) to 0 (centre ice) and 100 (end boards behind the OZ net)\n",
    "    - Y values range from -42.5 (west side boards) to 0 (centre ice) and 42.5 (east side boards)\n",
    "    - **When creating scatter plots, please use these coordinates along with the provided rink_template to display the full rink**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Binary columns that have values of 0 or 1 indicate 0=No, 1=Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Successfull passes are completed passes, successful shots are shots on net\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compiledgametime is in seconds, periods are 20 minutes long, except for overtime which is 5 minutes or less\n",
    "\n",
    "Please show all work, **keep written answers succinct and to the point** and most of all, thanks for your time and good luck!"

If the trend for either goalie continued overtime, it'd seem that their overall save % would reflect that. If their save % remained high, but in this area (or any for that matter) remained lower than their overall save %, that would be something to look into as a development coach, and to exploit as an opposing team.*"
